I&#39;m onboard with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett\">Terry Pratchett</a>&#39;s theory:</p><blockquote><p>“The reason that clichés become clichés is that they are the hammers and screwdrivers in the toolbox of communication.”</p></blockquote><p>In other words, clichés become blunt instruments over time. But they must have been insightful at <i>some</i> point. Otherwise, why would people have started using them?</p><p>That got me thinking. If clichés were once useful, can we still learn from them? I set out to reverse-engineer three of my least favorites. Here&#39;s how that panned out.</p><h2>Fake it &#39;til you make it</h2><p>I work a few hours a week at a running store selling shoes, and it&#39;s about as low-key as you could ask a part time job to be. But every once in a while, a customer walks in with this certain aura or neuroticism hanging off them—you just KNOW they&#39;re going to be a nightmare.</p><p>The other day, I had a woman march straight up to the counter and <i>demand</i> that someone &quot;fix her feet.&quot; She went on to list a string of twenty different ailments (plantar fasciitis, Morton&#39;s neuroma, tendinitis...) and wrapped up by asking, accusingly, &quot;Are you any good? Can you help me?&quot; Fucking hell.</p><p>Normally, I&#39;d pass off a customer like this to someone with more experience, but, for whatever reason, I just said, &quot;Sure, I can help you.&quot; Fifteen minutes later, she walked out of the store having bought the first shoe I pulled—literally beaming with joy over how much better her feet felt. It wasn&#39;t anything special. I would have brought the same shoe out for a hundred different customers. So what happened?</p><p>For starters, when I said &quot;I can help you,&quot; I didn&#39;t commit to solving every problem under the sun—I just opened a new avenue in the conversation. In other words, &quot;it&#39;s not yet clear <i>what</i> I&#39;ll be able to help with, but I <i>do</i> know that I can move you in a positive direction.&quot; This is a hell of a lot less stressful (and perilous) than faking experience you don&#39;t have.</p><p>Also, it&#39;s a ridiculously easy way to become more confident. Most people judge you based on a first impression—so when you answer every new challenge with some form of &quot;yes, and...&quot;, you&#39;re going to be remembered as a problem-solver (even you end up referring that person to someone else). Case-in-point, consider the two following approaches:</p><p><b>Person A: </b><i>&quot;Sorry, I can&#39;t help with that. Here&#39;s Chris.&quot;</i></p><p><b>Person B: </b><i>&quot;Sure, I can help you. Could you tell me more about _____? Ok, I see. I&#39;m going to introduce you to Chris, because he&#39;s an expert in _____.&quot;</i></p><p>Even though both people have the <i>same exact</i> level of experience and provide the <i>same exact</i> result, Person B seems way more confident. And they didn&#39;t even pretend they knew what they were doing. Crazy, right?</p><h3>The Takeaway</h3><p>Don&#39;t panic and give up every time an intimidating problem comes your way. If you say &quot;yes&quot; and open the conversation up to learn more, you&#39;ll often find that the solution is way simpler than you first expected it to be—that, or you&#39;ll realize you already have the skills you thought you were lacking.</p><h2>That&#39;s just the way it is</h2><p>My Dad likes to play Fifa (soccer) on Xbox 360—it&#39;s literally the only video game I&#39;ve ever gotten him to play. You can check the dusty cardboard graveyard under his TV for further proof: NBA 2K16, Madden 15, NHL 14, WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010...you get the picture.</p><p>As with every other millennial on the planet, my gaming skills far surpassed my Dad&#39;s, so we quickly ran into the trivial (but surprisingly annoying) problem of which difficulty level to play on.</p><p>&quot;Semi-Pro&quot; was too easy for me: every time I got the ball, I would just dribble around the doped-down AI players like Ronaldo schooling a bunch of firth-graders from the local rec league. We won every game. Conversely, &quot;Professional&quot; was too much for my Dad to handle. After a four or five-game losing streak, he would inevitably chuck his controller onto the couch or wax dejectedly about how &quot;the computer&quot; (what he calls any technology that&#39;s not a microwave or a fridge) was &quot;out to get us.&quot;</p><p>Like I said, a super-trivial problem. But, then again, it felt like a metaphor for a bigger conflict: the fact that I was in the &quot;grinding&quot; phase of my life (chasing big goals, working eighty hours a week, and growing multiple businesses) while my Dad was in the &quot;chilling&quot; phase of his life (coasting, watching the British Baking Show, and making art when he felt like it).</p><p>We were trapped in a &quot;that&#39;s just the way it is&quot; mentality, equally unsatisfied by our present options, and desperately wishing for the Xbox gods to bestow upon us a &quot;Sort-of-Professional&quot; difficulty level, that would have been—at best—a slightly less terrible compromise.</p><p>One day, it occurred to me that, instead of waiting for the game to change, we could simply write our own rules. So, I introduced the following plan: we would play on &quot;Semi-Pro,&quot; but if we scored three goals or more, we would play the next match on &quot;Professional.&quot; If we lost or tied on Professional, we would move back down to Semi-Pro...and so forth.</p><p>The new rules were a wild success. For one, I now felt like I had something to play for on Semi-Pro—scoring more goals was harder, and, thus, I didn&#39;t have to dumb-down my play. Secondly, and more interestingly, my Dad started playing really well on Professional. It wasn&#39;t the difficulty level that he got frustrated by before, but, rather, the lack of a comfort zone. If we were playing poorly, the disappointment felt endless to him. With the new rules, he always had Semi-Pro to fall back on, even though we started playing well enough to hardly ever need it.</p><h3>The Takeaway</h3><p>Our brains love to get stuck in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_loop\">faulty logic loops</a>, which make us feel like we&#39;ve exhausted all possible solutions. What you need to do is redefine the problem. In my case, I assumed that, because the game only allowed one difficulty setting at a time, my Dad and I both had to play on the same level. This wasn&#39;t true. Once I let go of that assumption, I was able to come up with a solution that benefited both of us equally—instead of just settling for a shitty compromise.</p><h2>You have to put yourself out there</h2><p>Over the past couple months, I&#39;ve been moving all the custom-coded websites I built as a freelance developer over to Squarespace. It was a no-brainer for most of my clients because their sites weren&#39;t that complex and using a website builder gives a non-techy person way more freedom to make changes themselves—plus I was offering to do it for free. Nice, right?</p><p>Weirdly, I got a lot of pushback. One client, in particular, threw a total curve ball by ghosting me for weeks, then suddenly hiring a totally unqualified IT &quot;professional&quot; to manage the existing website (his own site looked like it had stepped out of a time machine from 1992). This is <i>insane</i>, I thought. Everything will be exactly the same on Squarespace, except they&#39;ll pay a lot less and have more control. Who wouldn&#39;t want that?</p><p>After multiple emails back and forth—this only created more confusion—it finally occurred to me to pick up the phone and actually call my client. (How millennial of me.) Unsurprisingly, we cleared everything up in thirty seconds.</p><p>Back when I sent the first email, my client assumed that, because I wasn&#39;t providing maintenance anymore, she needed to hire a new &quot;webmaster.&quot; (A lot of small businesses still think this is a thing.) She literally didn&#39;t know a service existed that could allow her to edit a website herself. Once I explained how it worked, she got on board instantly.</p><p>What&#39;s this got to do with &quot;putting yourself out there,&quot; you ask? As an introvert, I naturally associate the words &quot;out there&quot; with attending schmaltzy networking events and forcing myself to socialize with people I hate. But I think what the phrase actually means is figuring out which course of action is the most likely to help you achieve a desired result.</p><p>When I told my client about moving her site to Squarespace, that was a knowledge bomb. I was afraid she might take it the wrong way, which is precisely why I should have just called her in the first place—talking to someone allows you to provide emotional support and catch confusion before it morphs into a bigger problem. Ironically, the reason why we <i>should</i> do something and the reason why we <i>don&#39;t</i> are often connected.</p><h3>The Takeaway</h3><p>Thinking of &quot;putting yourself out there&quot; as a chore is a huge mistake. What you want to do is snatch negative thought processes in mid air (&quot;this call could be a difficult call, so I&#39;ll just email&quot;), and pinpoint a positive opportunity (&quot;calling my client will make things clear and save time&quot;). You can apply this to virtually any situation.</p><p>For example, one of my longterm goals is to make a living at writing. I &quot;write&quot; in my head constantly—this is technically a medium, but not a very useful one for earning money. So, one level at a time, I expanded what &quot;out there&quot; meant to me: I started writing my ideas down (to not forget them), I stored them in Notion (for organization), I created a blog (to get them where they can actually be read), and began promoting them (so people know my writing exists). Pretty soon, I&#39;ll launch a podcast...and the list goes on, until I&#39;m making a certain amount of money. Then I&#39;ll set new goals and figure out where I need to &quot;put myself&quot; to make them happen. Where do you need to put yourself?</p><h2>Clichés: Eliminated</h2><p>Oh man, that was cathartic. As much as I hate clichés, I think they&#39;re a gold mine for insight if you take a little time to reverse-engineer them. What are your top three least favorites?
