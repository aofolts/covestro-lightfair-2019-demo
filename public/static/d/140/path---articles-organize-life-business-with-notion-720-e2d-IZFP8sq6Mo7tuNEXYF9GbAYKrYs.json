It&#39;s not just you.</h2><p>Whether you&#39;re freelancing, running a business, or just trying to train for a 5k, you&#39;ve probably turned to productivity apps at some point — Evernote (for quick ideas), DropBox (for file sharing), Google Docs (for collaborative writing), Trello (for project management), LinkedIn (for networking)...the list goes on.</p><p>I&#39;m guilty of using too many apps. We all are. But up until a few days ago I didn&#39;t know there was a better option. One app can&#39;t do everything, can it?</p><h2>Enter Notion</h2><p>I first heard about Notion on the <a href=\"https://syntax.fm/\">Syntaxt</a> podcast (shoutout to Wes Bos and Scott Tolinski). And while I had no clue what it even was, the name sounded interesting, so I decided to check it out.</p><p>Notion&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/\">landing page</a> is super-minimal. In fact, it&#39;s so minimal that I <i>almost</i> clicked away—here we go again with another half-assed &quot;one-in-all&quot; productivity app, I thought.</p><p>But thank god I scrolled, because further down the page was a live, fully-interactive demo of Notion&#39;s app. (Seriously, how ballsy is it to let people loose on an app with zero context? You really have to believe in your product).</p><p>After playing around for about thirty seconds, it became clear to me that Notion was not just another do-it-all app. I happily signed up for a free account.</p><h2>Hour one with Notion</h2><p>I really can&#39;t think of an app I&#39;ve fallen in love with faster than Notion. It does so many things so well that&#39;s it&#39;s actually hard to describe. But let me put it this way...</p><blockquote><p>Imagine if The New Yorker, BaseCamp, and Evernote had a lovechild.</p></blockquote><p>My first foray into Notion&#39;s app was porting over all the content I was working on—I created a page called &quot;Blog Posts,&quot; then proceeded to add sub-pages for each post, which I realized was as easy as typing &quot;/&quot;.</p><p>I also set up some pages for groceries, random ideas, back burner tasks, and daily todo items (more on that in a bit).</p><h3>Sub Pages</h3><p>Notion automatically stores sub-pages in a folder-like structure under the parent page. Pretty cool, huh? Well, keep reading, my friend, because that&#39;s just one of about ten million things Notion just does &quot;automatically.&quot;</p><h2>Day one with Notion</h2><h3>Slash Command</h3><p>Slash commands really are a thing of beauty in Notion. You can use them to create pages, headings, inline images, references, and a whole lot more—the writing experience is just as fluid as <a href=\"https://medium.com/\">Medium</a> and ten times more powerful.</p><p>One &quot;Block&quot; I took advantage of almost immediately is the &quot;To-do List.&quot; While Notion isn&#39;t a replacement for a full-on project management app, a basic checkbox list covers 99% of my personal and solo business use-cases.</p><h3>Mention</h3><p>You can Mention pages in Notion by typing &quot;@&quot;, which creates a link to that content. Like Wikipedia, this allows you to jump between related assets much more quickly than rooting through your filesystem over and over.</p><p>If you really want to get fancy, you can Mention a date inside a To-do item, which sends an email message and mobile alert at the specified time so you don&#39;t forget to complete the task. Notion is even smart enough to covert &quot;@Next Tuesday&quot; into a real date.</p><h3>Custom Databases</h3><p>I was already sold on Notion after the first few minutes, but the feature that really sealed the deal for me was the Database page.</p><p>At first, I thought &quot;Database&quot; just meant a data table, so I ignored it.</p><p>However, after loading 10+ articles under my &quot;Blog Posts&quot; page, I realized sub-pages weren&#39;t a sustainable way to organize lots of content. I took a closer look at the Database feature, and was completely blown away.</p><p>While Notion Databases <i>look</i> like regular tables, they&#39;re much more flexible under the hood. You can add custom properties, filters, and views—and each row opens (yup, you guessed it) a fully-editable Notion page.</p><h2>Week one with Notion</h2><p>Before stumbling across Notion, I repeatedly tried (and failed) to devise an organizational system to store all the information I need to access on a regular basis.</p><p>I used it all: project management apps, note taking apps, physical journals, note cards...I even made a go of it on my website&#39;s CMS, <a href=\"https://www.contentful.com/\">Contentful</a>. Nothing fit the bill. That&#39;s why I&#39;m so excited about Notion—it truly is a all-in-one solution.</p><h3>People and Projects</h3><p>I mentioned earlier (no pun intended) about how useful Mentions are for linking content, and one of the best use cases I&#39;ve discovered is interconnecting common data between my Contacts and Projects.</p><p>For example, in the Projects database, each project has a property called &quot;Primary Contact.&quot; In this, I link to a person in my Contacts database. That gives me quick access to the person&#39;s info—and if anything changes, I don&#39;t have to manually update stuff in fifty different places, because there&#39;s only one &quot;source of truth.&quot;</p><p>Custom properties also give me the power to filter my databases and set up different &quot;Views.&quot; For example, I have Views for different types of Contacts based on their &quot;Relation&quot; to me: &quot;Contractor,&quot; &quot;Client,&quot; &quot;Lead,&quot; etc.</p><p><i>Nerdy footnote: I originally set my &quot;Primary Contact&quot; property to accept text. In each row, I was Mentioning (linking to) a certain Contact. I then realized Notion supports &quot;Relation&quot; properties that are meant for this—when I made the switch Notion magically converted all my inline Mention links into regular Relation links. Sweet!</i></p><h3>Recurring Tasks</h3><p>I&#39;ll be honest, I&#39;m pretty disorganized by nature. Even simple daily tasks like fixing meals and working out tend to fall by the wayside when I get busy and/or distracted.</p><p>With Notion, my personal and business tasks are now in one place.</p><p>I have to-do pages for today&#39;s tasks, daily tasks, and weekly tasks, as well as a planning page for my longterm goals. By simply checking Notion a few times a day, I can easily see what needs doing, and my productivity has shot way up, as a result.</p><h3>Process, Resources, Inspiration</h3><p>Like I said before, Notion is sort of like your own personal Wikipedia. I took that idea and ran with it during my first week, creating three more databases: Process (for documentation), Resources (for books, podcasts, videos, etc), and Inspiration (for design samples).</p><p>While I&#39;m currently a one-man shop, I&#39;ll inevitably be adding more people to my team, and that means cultivating a high-quality knowledge base of processes and best practices. Whenever I add a new Process to the database, I Mention (link to) other Processes wherever possible, which creates a richer, more deeply-connected collection of content.</p><p>Resources works more as a database of external information that I can enter once and search for later—by Title, Author, or even Keywords. Inspiration is similar, except I use a &quot;Board View&quot; to paw through designs, photos, and websites when I&#39;m trying to brainstorm ideas for a new project.</p><h2>TL;DR:  Four reasons to start using Notion today</h2><p>I&#39;ve been using Notion for less that a week, and I&#39;m already seeing huge benefits. If you haven&#39;t given it a try yet, here are my top favorite features (aka why you should go give it a try right now).</p><ol><li><p><b>One source of truth:</b> Notion won&#39;t replace </p><p><i>every</i></p><p> app you use, but it might kill off 3-5.</p></li><li><p><b>Flexibility: </b>You can define a digital workspace that makes sense to you.</p></li><li><p><b>Linking:</b> Bounce between related content ten times faster than your filesystem.</p></li><li><p><b>Databases:</b> Store, sort, filter, and search your content however you want.</p></li></ol><h2>Thanks for reading!</h2><p>If you&#39;re already using Notion, drop a comment below or message me @aofolts—I&#39;d love to hear what else people are using it for.</p>"}},"coverImage":{"title":"Clothespins light","alt":"","fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/jbawaa5001ko/3VWUHLUqW5kfuFplRzHXi2/d903a069347e660bc523f4498710a2aa/peg-238525_1920.jpg?w=1920&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/jbawaa5001ko/3VWUHLUqW5kfuFplRzHXi2/d903a069347e660bc523f4498710a2aa/peg-238525_1920.jpg?w=480&h=320&q=50 480w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/jbawaa5001ko/3VWUHLUqW5kfuFplRzHXi2/d903a069347e660bc523f4498710a2aa/peg-238525_1920.jpg?w=960&h=640&q=50 960w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/jbawaa5001ko/3VWUHLUqW5kfuFplRzHXi2/d903a069347e660bc523f4498710a2aa/peg-238525_1920.jpg?w=1920&h=1280&q=50 1920w","sizes":"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"}},"author":{"name":"Andrew Folts","avatar":{"title":"Andrew Folts profile photo","alt":"","fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/jbawaa5001ko/2zp1feJo07IiG6YwZXudNr/ecc0f0eaf4e5952ddef7f0a3bb706569/smiling-lumberjack-1.jpg?w=250&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/jbawaa5001ko/2zp1feJo07IiG6YwZXudNr/ecc0f0eaf4e5952ddef7f0a3bb706569/smiling-lumberjack-1.jpg?w=63&h=63&q=50 63w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/jbawaa5001ko/2zp1feJo07IiG6YwZXudNr/ecc0f0eaf4e5952ddef7f0a3bb706569/smiling-lumberjack-1.jpg?w=125&h=125&q=50 125w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/jbawaa5001ko/2zp1feJo07IiG6YwZXudNr/ecc0f0eaf4e5952ddef7f0a3bb706569/smiling-lumberjack-1.jpg?w=250&h=250&q=50 250w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/jbawaa5001ko/2zp1feJo07IiG6YwZXudNr/ecc0f0eaf4e5952ddef7f0a3bb706569/smiling-lumberjack-1.jpg?w=375&h=375&q=50 375w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/jbawaa5001ko/2zp1feJo07IiG6YwZXudNr/ecc0f0eaf4e5952ddef7f0a3bb706569/smiling-lumberjack-1.jpg?w=500&h=500&q=50 500w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/jbawaa5001ko/2zp1feJo07IiG6YwZXudNr/ecc0f0eaf4e5952ddef7f0a3bb706569/smiling-lumberjack-1.jpg?w=628&h=628&q=50 628w","sizes":"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"organize-life-business-with-notion"}}
