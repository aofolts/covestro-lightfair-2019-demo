But here’s the ironic part…</p><p>Tinder’s success (like a lot of dating apps) is reliant upon its users failure. Think about it. If everyone who used Tinder suddenly found their soulmate, the company would be out of business tomorrow.</p><p>Tinder <i>wants </i>us to be miserable.</p><p>I’m not saying Tinder has some evil plan for world domination or that it’s bad for everyone. But, in general, dating apps work exactly like casinos—the more desperate and unconfident you are, the more likely you are to come back and spend big.</p><p>Let’s compare, shall we?</p><h2>Stage 1: Winning</h2><p>If you’ve ever used Tinder, OKCupid, Match.com, etc, you know how great it feels to open up a dating app for the first time. The upfront investment is next to nil—just a profile picture and a couple sentences.</p><p>In a few seconds, you’re swiping away. There are so many attractive people, you can’t help but think the odds are stacked in your favor. Just like a casino, maybe you win big—you win the “jackpot”, and match with someone who might normally be “way out of your league”. Who knows, maybe you even land a date.</p><p>Damn, this is so much easier than normal dating. Life is good.</p><h2>Stage 2: Losing</h2><p>You know the phrase “the house always wins”… well, that also applies to dating apps, because the odds of actually meeting someone are pretty low for most people. If we can believe Pew, <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/02/29/5-facts-about-online-dating/\">66% of people have never gotten a single date</a>. Yikes.</p><p>Understandably, you probably start feeling frustrated after a few months. You think about quitting, but you don’t because swiping is a lot easier than actually going out and meeting people in the real world… who has time for that, right?</p><p>The whole process becomes addictive—right, right, left, right, left, left, left. You spend more and more time in the app, and get fewer and fewer results, while simultaneously losing more and more confidence in your ability to engage with people who aren’t presented in a square frame on your phone.</p><h2>Stage 3: Hopelessness</h2><p>It’s common knowledge that <a href=\"http://time.com/4439084/tinder-online-dating-self-esteem/\">dating apps can make you feel generally shitty about yourself</a>, but I think there’s a bigger problem.</p><p>When we’re frustrated, we often narrow our thinking in order to focus on the problem at hand—so much so that we develop Mental Blinders, which literally prevent us from considering alternative solutions.</p><p>Tinder and other dating apps are designed to keep us in this state. As we feel more powerless and hopeless, the hollow, effortless action of swiping through photos becomes more enticing.</p><h2>Get out!</h2><p>If dating apps are working out for you, awesome. If not, stop what you’re doing RIGHT NOW and delete them off your phone. These apps will happily consume your time, energy, and money if you let them—exactly like a casino.</p><p>Once you’ve done that, here’s a few ideas on dating without apps:</p><p><b>Do something: </b>No matter how jaded or intimidated you feel about going out and meeting people, I can 100% guarantee it will be a better use of your time than flipping through profiles on your phone. Join a book club, learn how to rock climb, or volunteer a few hours a week. You’ll get to know people faster than some random stranger on Tinder. Even if you don’t meet your soulmate, the worst case scenario is you make friends or pick up a new hobby.</p><p><b>Use your free time: </b>Even if you only use a dating app for 15 minutes a day, that’s time you can easily invest in something that will actually make your life better. Read up on a subject you’re interested in, go for a run, or start teaching yourself a new skill!</p><p><b>Be interested in people: </b>One of the worst things about dating apps is that they’re mostly appearance-based. I’m guilty (we all are) of making snap judgements that rule out people based on shallow characteristics. Often, we’ll get locked into thinking that we have to make a connection with everyone we meet. A more productive mindset is just to be interested in learning about people. If you’re open it, you can take something away from any interaction, whether or not you like that person. Dating can really be a pain sometimes, but if you master this skill, you’ll never feel like you’re wasting time on a bad experience.</p>"}},"coverImage":{"title":"dating-apps-phone","alt":"","fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5051740357478833,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/jbawaa5001ko/4gV15pkd5oVBLc2vyFT5xG/51fc32cfefe1b37f721e89a7fc56a21b/dating-apps-phone.jpg?w=1920&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/jbawaa5001ko/4gV15pkd5oVBLc2vyFT5xG/51fc32cfefe1b37f721e89a7fc56a21b/dating-apps-phone.jpg?w=480&h=319&q=50 480w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/jbawaa5001ko/4gV15pkd5oVBLc2vyFT5xG/51fc32cfefe1b37f721e89a7fc56a21b/dating-apps-phone.jpg?w=960&h=638&q=50 960w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/jbawaa5001ko/4gV15pkd5oVBLc2vyFT5xG/51fc32cfefe1b37f721e89a7fc56a21b/dating-apps-phone.jpg?w=1600&h=1063&q=50 1600w","sizes":"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"}},"author":{"name":"Andrew Folts","avatar":{"title":"Andrew Folts profile photo","alt":"","fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/jbawaa5001ko/2zp1feJo07IiG6YwZXudNr/ecc0f0eaf4e5952ddef7f0a3bb706569/smiling-lumberjack-1.jpg?w=250&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/jbawaa5001ko/2zp1feJo07IiG6YwZXudNr/ecc0f0eaf4e5952ddef7f0a3bb706569/smiling-lumberjack-1.jpg?w=63&h=63&q=50 63w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/jbawaa5001ko/2zp1feJo07IiG6YwZXudNr/ecc0f0eaf4e5952ddef7f0a3bb706569/smiling-lumberjack-1.jpg?w=125&h=125&q=50 125w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/jbawaa5001ko/2zp1feJo07IiG6YwZXudNr/ecc0f0eaf4e5952ddef7f0a3bb706569/smiling-lumberjack-1.jpg?w=250&h=250&q=50 250w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/jbawaa5001ko/2zp1feJo07IiG6YwZXudNr/ecc0f0eaf4e5952ddef7f0a3bb706569/smiling-lumberjack-1.jpg?w=375&h=375&q=50 375w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/jbawaa5001ko/2zp1feJo07IiG6YwZXudNr/ecc0f0eaf4e5952ddef7f0a3bb706569/smiling-lumberjack-1.jpg?w=500&h=500&q=50 500w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/jbawaa5001ko/2zp1feJo07IiG6YwZXudNr/ecc0f0eaf4e5952ddef7f0a3bb706569/smiling-lumberjack-1.jpg?w=628&h=628&q=50 628w","sizes":"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"dating-apps-designed-make-you-unhappy"}}
