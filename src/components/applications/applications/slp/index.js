  The CircLED™ housing is injection molded at SLP Lighting's manufacturing plant in Missouri with thermally conductive <b>Makrolon© TC8030</b> polycarbonate from Covestro. The material provides strong heat-transferring capability, enabling the design to maintain an acceptable steady state temperature. Covestro worked closely with SLP Lighting, providing part and mold design support, substantial CAE thermal simulations and physical testing to validate material performance in the application.
